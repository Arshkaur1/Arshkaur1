# Hi there 👋

I'm Arsh, a Data Science & Analytics graduate student at University of Calgary 🇨🇦

🔍 I'm passionate about data-driven storytelling, machine learning, and solving impactful real-world problems.  
💻 I've worked on projects in fraud detection, financial analytics, and ESG Analytics.

🌱 I’m always learning — currently understanding more financial optimization.  
📊 I love building dashboards, predictive models, and scalable data pipelines.

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me exploring coffee shops ☕, reading case studies 🤓, or hiking 🏞️.
